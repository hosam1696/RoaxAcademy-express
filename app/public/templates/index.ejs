            <h2>Who are we?</h2>
            <p>The Roux Academy gets thousands of submissions every year for artists interesting in participating in the
                CAC exhibits, and selects approximately 200 distinct pieces of contemporary art for display in their
                collective exhibit. In addition, 12 individuals are honored as Featured Artists - each being granted his
                or her own exhibit hall to display entire collections or themed pieces.</p>
            <p>Each Featured Artist has an opportunity to speak at one of our meetups and share his or her vision,
                perspective, and techniques with attendees on a more personal level than at our large conference. It is
                truly an honor to be a CAC Featured Artist and many past students artists who were featured at CAC have
                gone on to brilliant careers in art.</p>
